~~Interpreting~~
1.  The top results returned by GLOVE all use 'I' a lot, which was in the original query, and the top results all have the word 'job' in them even if the topic of the tweets
is not necessarily about a job in the workplace sense. The reason for this may be that GLOVE seems to use more word similarity (i.e. "Training for GloVe is "performed on aggregated global 
word-word co-occurrence statistics from a corpus, and the resulting representations showcase interesting linear substructures of the word vector space" (https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/)) 
to determine the similarity score between query and documents.

Meanwhile, for MINLIM the top 25 results all relate to job hunting or something similar. Some tweets returned by MINLIM do not even have the word 'job' or 'I' in them, but because 
their meaning relates to job hunting, they are in the top results. The reason for this is likely that it uses semantic meaning 
to evaluate similarity rather than word co-occurrence. 


2. I do not think Twitter is using a semantic search technique like the ones we tried because the results of the query on Twitter contain tweets that contain the exact
words contained in the query. Rather than results generally mentioning word-related topics like what MINLIM returned, Twitter returned tweets
containing the query word-for-word. This could also be due to the larger amount of data it has to work with, but the word-matching seems
pretty clear based on the results.
