My GPT-2 Story:
---------------
I like painting pretty pictures, but I don't think I've ever done anything like that before."

"I'm not sure if it's because I'm a painter or not," he said. "I think that's what I like to do. It's just a matter of time before I get to the point where I can do something like this. I think it would be cool if I could do it in a different way. Maybe I'd like it a little bit more. But I haven't really done that yet, so I'll have to wait and see how it goes."


He added: "It's been a long time since I did a painting, and I really like the way it looks. There are a lot of things that you can't do with a paintbrush. You can paint a picture and it doesn't look like you're going to be able to get it out of your hand. That's one of the things I love about painting. When I first started, I didn't know how to use a brush. Then I started doing it. Now I have a really good idea of how I want it to look. If I paint it like I used to, it will look really nice."
